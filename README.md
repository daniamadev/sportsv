First of all, you need to install json-server from NPM. [Download it here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) or type `npm install -g json-server`.
Json-server is responsible for mocking up api.json. It runs the endpoint in http://localhost:3000 but you can change the port just typing -p 4000, for example.
To run the endpoint, open the terminal and type `json-server --watch api.json`


Now you can open your terminal in the exactly project folder and type **npm install** to install all the dependencies that are listed in *package.json*.

After that, run **npm start** and the application will start.

Things that are important to know:

1. Table is running as specified;
2. User can be added in the table if you click on Save;
3. Delete icon is displayed as mouse hover;
4. User can be deleted if you click on button;
5. React developer tools (if installed) can show what is being typed in search input.
